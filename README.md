# Forecast Crypto

This is a port-over from the `swhite` branch of [Lecture 1](https://gitlabstats-prd/StatsMethods/time-series-network/learning/arima-modelling/lecture-1/-/tree/swhite). 

# Goal

1.) Work through the modelling framework presented in [Forecasting: Principles and Practice - 9.7](https://otexts.com/fpp3/arima-r.html) to develop some ARIMA models for crypto currencies.  A training set is used.  
2.) Trial some basic trading strategies with the models on a test set and evaluate performance.
