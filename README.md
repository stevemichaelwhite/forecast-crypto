# StatsNZ ARIMA Training 2021

**Note**

## Exercises I  

• Find a monthly series time series which is at least 15 years in length. It
can be anything you find interesting, so does not have to be a StatsNZ
series. You might want to consult others to see if someone else is interested
in it too. While it is much better if you do your own analysis on a time
series it is helpful if, after you have done your work, you can compare
your results with someone independently working on the same time series.

* If your are struggling to think of anything here are some suggestions
    - Monthly visitor arrivals
    - Monthly merchandise exports
    - Monthly residential building consents
• Get your series into an R time series object.
• Plot the series. You have succeeded in previous step if the x-axis has date
labels
• Put a line at any time point. In other words, if you talk about a series at
March 2004, for example, can you put a line at that point?
• Produce the ACF for your time series.
