## Exercise I  

**Note:** *This exercise might be a good litmus test to see if you have the time to dedicate to the course as this will be the least demanding exercise.*


***  

* Find a monthly series time series which is at least 15 years in length. It
can be anything you find interesting, so does not have to be a StatsNZ
series. You might want to consult others to see if someone else is interested
in it too. While it is much better if you do your own analysis on a time
series, it is helpful if, after you have done your work, you can compare
your results with someone independently working on the same time series.   
* If your are struggling to think of anything here are some suggestions   
    * Monthly visitor arrivals   
    * Monthly merchandise exports   
    * Monthly residential building consents   
* Get your series into an R time series object.   
* Plot the series. You have succeeded in previous step if the x-axis has date labels.   
* Put a vertical line at any time point. In other words, if you talk about a series at March 2004, for example, can you put a vertical line at that time point?
* Produce the ACF for your time series.
